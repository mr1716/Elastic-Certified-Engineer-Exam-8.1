# Searching Data

:warning: These example questions use the eCommerce sample data and the Shakespeare data.


# Prerequisite

:scroll: Download the Shakespeare data, create an index mapping as below and insert the data.

:arrow_down: https://download.elastic.co/demos/kibana/gettingstarted/shakespeare_6.0.json

(this is also contained in the data folder of this repo)

```json
PUT /shakespeare
{
 "mappings": {
   "properties": {
    "speaker": {"type": "keyword"},
    "play_name": {"type": "keyword"},
    "line_id": {"type": "integer"},

  }
 }
}

# Write an asynchronous search

It is better to be aware of the concepts and be able to look this up in the online manuals in the exam.

> - The `date_histogram` is the Y-axis

Basially here, you create each aggregation separately and then combine in the end.

Create the `date_histogram` as in the previous example.
```json 
GET kibana_sample_data_ecommerce/_search?filter_path=aggregations
{
  "size":0,
  "aggs": {
    "date_hist_y_axis": {
      "date_histogram": {
        "field": "order_date",
        "calendar_interval": "1d",
        "min_doc_count": 1
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Aggregate by the `category` grouping - here you are testing your sub-aggregation.

You should also note the number of categories, so you don't `size` the aggregation too small later on.

```json
GET kibana_sample_data_ecommerce/_search?filter_path=aggregations
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "cat_keyword": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "category.keyword"
      }
    }
  }
}

// output
{
  "aggregations" : {
    "cat_keyword" : {
      "doc_count_error_upper_bound" : 0,
      "sum_other_doc_count" : 0,
      "buckets" : [
        {
          "key" : "Men's Clothing",
          "doc_count" : 2024
        },
        {
          "key" : "Women's Clothing",
          "doc_count" : 1903
        },
        {
          "key" : "Women's Shoes",
          "doc_count" : 1136
        },
        {
          "key" : "Men's Shoes",
          "doc_count" : 944
        },
        {
          "key" : "Women's Accessories",
          "doc_count" : 830
        },
