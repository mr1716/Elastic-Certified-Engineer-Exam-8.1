A data stream lets you store append-only time series data across multiple indices while giving you a single named resource for requests. Data streams are well-suited for logs, events, metrics, and other continuously generated data.

## Mapping 
Mapping is the process of defining how a document, and the fields it contains, are stored and indexed.
Each document is a collection of fields, which each have their own data type. When mapping your data, you create a mapping definition, which contains a list of fields that are pertinent to the document.
A mapping definition also includes metadata fields, like the _source field, which customize how a documentâ€™s associated metadata is handled.
