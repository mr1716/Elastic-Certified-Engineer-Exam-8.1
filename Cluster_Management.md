# Backup and restore a cluster and/or specific indices

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.1/snapshots-take-snapshot.html

> You cannot back up an Elasticsearch cluster by simply taking a copy of the data directories of all of its nodes. 
> 
> Elasticsearch may be making changes to the contents of its data directories while it is running; copying its data directories cannot be expected to capture a consistent picture of their contents. 
>
> If you try to restore a cluster from such a backup, it may fail and report corruption and/or missing files. Alternatively, it may appear to have succeeded though it silently lost some of its data. 
> 
> The only reliable way to back up a cluster is by using the snapshot and restore functionality.

## To have a complete backup for your cluster:

- Back up the data
- Back up the cluster configuration
- Back up the security configuration

## To restore your cluster from a backup:

- Restore the data
- Restore the security configuration

### Version Compatibility
> Version compatibility refers to the underlying Lucene index compatibility. Follow the Upgrade documentation when migrating between versions.
>
> A snapshot contains a copy of the on-disk data structures that make up an index. This means that snapshots can only be restored to versions of Elasticsearch that can read the indices:

- A snapshot of an index created in 6.x can be restored to 7.x.
- A snapshot of an index created in 5.x can be restored to 6.x.
- A snapshot of an index created in 2.x can be restored to 5.x.
- A snapshot of an index created in 1.x can be restored to 2.x.


### Repositories
> You must register a snapshot repository before you can perform snapshot and restore operations. We recommend creating a new snapshot repository for each major version. The valid repository settings depend on the repository type.

<details>
  <summary>View Solution (click to reveal)</summary>

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.1/snapshot-restore.html

You will need to make sure that the `path.repo` setting has been applied to each ElasticSearch node before doing this.

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.1/snapshots-register-repository.html

The docker images in this Git Repository have this set in the `1es-1kb-xpackSec.yml` single node cluster.  Which was used predominately through out the other sections.

Normally you would save the snapshots to share storage like NFS, AWS S3 etc.   In this demo we use the local filesystem `/tmp` this is not recommended in production.


This can all be done in the kibana GUI https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.1/snapshot-restore.html

## Check that path.repo is set

```json
GET /_nodes?pretty&filter_path=nodes.*.settings.path

// output

{
  "nodes" : {
    "HKbyLT8xRMC08bJO32XNFg" : {
      "settings" : {
        "path" : {
          "logs" : "/usr/share/elasticsearch/logs",
          "home" : "/usr/share/elasticsearch",
          "repo" : "/tmp"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
As you can see the `path.repo` is set to `/tmp`.

## Regster the backup location
```json
PUT /_snapshot/my_test_backup
{
    "type": "fs",
    "settings": {
        "location": "/tmp/test1",
        "compress": true
    }
}

// output

{
  "acknowledged" : true
}
```
Notice that `/tmp` needed to be available and that you can then append a path to that.  eg. `/tmp/test1`


## Make a snapshot, to that registered location

Date math requires the snapshot name to be enclosed in angled brackets '<>' that is: '%3C' '%3E'

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.1/api-conventions.html#api-date-math-index-names
  > You must enclose date math names in angle brackets. If you use the name in a request path, `special characters must be URI encoded.`

```json
PUT /_snapshot/my_test_backup/%3Cshakespeare-snapshot-%7Bnow%2Fd%7D%3E
{
  "indices": "shakespeare",
  "ignore_unavailable": true,
  "include_global_state": false
}
```

## Check the snapshot

3. :closed_book: Backup/Restore the cluster configuration

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.1/snapshots-take-snapshot.html#back-up-config-files
> We recommend that you take regular (ideally, daily) backups of your Elasticsearch config ($ES_PATH_CONF) directory using the file backup software of your choice.

Normally `/etc/elasticsearch`

> Some settings in configuration files might be overridden by cluster settings. You can capture these settings in a data backup snapshot by specifying the include_global_state: true (default) parameter for the snapshot API. 
>
>Alternatively, you can extract these configuration values in text format by using the get settings API:

```json
GET _cluster/settings?pretty&flat_settings&filter_path=persistent
```

So, it's a probably good idea to backup your `/etc/elasticsearch/` folder and run an external API call to download the persistant settings to a text file.

4. :closed_book: Backup/Restore the Security configuration

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.1/security-backup.html (just a reference to the following 2 links)
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.1/snapshots-take-snapshot.html#back-up-config-files
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.1/snapshots-take-snapshot.html#cluster-state-snapshots  
## Back up file-based security configuration
> Elasticsearch security features are configured using the xpack.security namespace inside the elasticsearch.yml and elasticsearch.keystore files. In addition there are several other extra configuration files inside the same ES_PATH_CONF directory. These files define roles and role mappings and configure the file realm. 

## Back up index-based security configuration

> Elasticsearch security features store system configuration data inside a dedicated index. This index is named .security-6 in the Elasticsearch 6.x versions and .security-7 in the 7.x releases. The .security alias always points to the appropriate index. This index contains the data which is not available in configuration files and cannot be reliably backed up using standard filesystem tools. This data describes:
>
> - the definition of users in the native realm (including hashed passwords)
> - role definitions (defined via the create roles API)
> - role mappings (defined via the create role mappings API)
> - application privileges
> - API keys
>
> The .security index thus contains resources and definitions in addition to configuration information. All of that information is required in a complete security features backup.

> Use the standard Elasticsearch snapshot functionality to backup .security, as you would for any other data index.
>
> Snapshot the .security index in a dedicated repository, where read and write access is strictly restricted and audited.

So, backup the `/etc/elasticsearch` folder,

and

snapshot the `.security` index alias.


## Restore the Security index

# Configure a snapshot to be searchable
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.1/searchable-snapshots.html
> Searchable snapshots let you use snapshots to search infrequently accessed and read-only data in a very cost-effective fashion. The cold and frozen data tiers use searchable snapshots to reduce your storage and operating costs.
> 
> Searchable snapshots eliminate the need for replica shards, potentially halving the local storage needed to search your data. Searchable snapshots rely on the same snapshot mechanism you already use for backups and have minimal impact on your snapshot repository storage costs.

# Implement cross-cluster replication

> With cross-cluster replication, you can replicate indices across clusters to:

> - Continue handling search requests in the event of a datacenter outage
> - Prevent search volume from impacting indexing throughput
> - Reduce search latency by processing search requests in geo-proximity to the user
>
> Cross-cluster replication uses an active-passive model. You index to a leader index, and the data is replicated to one or more read-only follower indices. Before you can add a follower index to a cluster, you must configure the remote cluster that contains the leader index.

<details>
  <summary>View Solution (click to reveal)</summary>

## Docker compose

Use the `2es-2kibana-xpack-cluster-713.yml` docker compose file.
This also requires `kibana-east.yml` and `kibana-west.yml`.

The docker-compose file has the correct node settings applied.

`node.roles=master,data,ingest,remote_cluster_client`

## Licencing

You will have to setup a 30day trial licence, to be able to do this part of the lab. This can easily be done once the nodes are up.

`Stack Management -> License management -> Start a 30-day trial -> Start trial {click} -> Start my trial {click}`

## Create cluster replication

Do this in Kibana as per the instructions above.

:warning: You will have to start one incognito/private browsing session or use different browsers to connect to both kibana instnaces at once.  This is due to the browser security cookies overwriting each other and subsequently logging you out everytime. :)

`Stack Management -> Remote Clusters -> Add a remote cluster`


| Cluster | Kibana URL | Remote Name | Seed Nodes | Direction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| East | http://\<your host ip>:5601 | west-cluster | esnode-west:9300 | Leader | 
| West | http://\<your host ip>:5602 | east-cluster | esnode-east:9300 | Follower |


## Add sample data

Add the sample data to the Leader (east)

Add the Kibana eCommerce sample data.

## Set up cross-cluster replication

Replicate the following index from East to West.

`kibana_sample_data_ecommerce`


> The index status changes to Paused. When the remote recovery process is complete, the index following begins and the status changes to Active.


## Create an auto-follow pattern and add documents to the index

On West, create an auto-follow pattern `test-ccr-index-*`

On East, create a timeseries index `test-ccr-index-000000`

Add docs to the new time series index, and confirm they are on West

# Define role-based access control using Elasticsearch Security

>  :warning: :warning: :warning: IMPORTANT NOTE: from here on it is assumed you have a working kibana node to work from the "development console" and that you have imported the sample data.

> See: [Running test servers on docker](Test_servers_on_docker.md)

> See: [Importing Sample data](Importing_sample_data.md)

:question: To do this section you need to:

- create roles and users

:warning: Not all of the security features can be used due to Basic Licence limitations.

You will see an error like the below if you have a Basic licence.

The following role parameters are not available under Basic licence.

```yaml
  "field_security" : { ... }, # field level security
  "query": "..." # document level security
```

Error message:
```yaml
{
  "error": {
    "root_cause": [
      {
        "type": "security_exception",
        "reason": "current license is non-compliant for [field and document level security]",
        "license.expired.feature": "field and document level security"
      }
    ],
    "type": "security_exception",
    "reason": "current license is non-compliant for [field and document level security]",
    "license.expired.feature": "field and document level security"
  },
  "status": 403
}
```

## Create a role

:warning: This assumes you have ingested the Elastic sample data.
> See: [Importing Sample data](Importing_sample_data.md)

### :question:  Create role and user for the following:

- a role called `flights_all` for read only access on the Flight sample data
- the role should have cluster monitor access
- a user called `flight_reader_all` that has the role applied
- the user password should be `flight123`

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.1/built-in-roles.html
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.1/security-privileges.html

```json
PUT _security/role/flights_all
{
  "cluster": [ "monitor" ],
  "indices": [
    {
      "names": ["kibana_sample_data_flights"],
      "privileges": ["read","view_index_metadata", "monitor"]
    }
  ]
}

PUT _security/user/flight_reader_all
{
  "password": "flight123",
  "roles": [ "kibana_user", "flights_all" ],
  "full_name": "flights all",
  "email": "fa@abc.com"
}
```

Test the user access

- Logout as elastic 
- Login to Kibana as `flight_reader_all` password `flight123`
- Go to dev console and see what indices you have access to.

Check that we can access the index stats (monitor)
and only the index we have allowed access to.

```json
GET _cat/indices

green open kibana_sample_data_flights R1AptZYHTrivEUEmtftubg 1 0 13059 0 6.6mb 6.6mb
```

Check that we can query the index.  Get the document count

```json
GET kibana_sample_data_flights/_count

{
  "count" : 13059,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  }
}
```

### :question:  Create a role with field and document level security, plus a user for the following:

:warning: can only be applied if you have purchased an elastic licence. This will not work on the Basic/Free licence.

- a role called `flights_australia` for read only access on the Flght data that only allows access to data that has a Destination Country of Australia.
- the following fields are allowed to be displayed: Flight Number, Country of Origin and City of Origin
- a user called `flight_reader_au` should have the role applied to it

```json

# test your query first
POST kibana_sample_data_flights/_search
{
  "query": {
        "match": {
          "DestCountry": "AU"
        }
      }
}

PUT _security/role/flights_australia
{
  "indices": [
    {
      "names": [
        "kibana_sample_data_flights"
      ],
      "privileges": [
        "read"
      ],
      "field_security": {
        "grant": ["FlightNum", "OriginCountry", "OriginCityName"]
      }, 
      "query": {
        "match": {
          "DestCountry": "AU"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Create a user for that role

```yaml
PUT _security/user/flight_reader_au
{
  "password": "flight123",
  "roles": "flights_australia",
  "full_name": "flights australia",
  "email": "fau@abc.com"
}
```

Test

- Logout as elastic 
- Login to Kibana as `flight_reader_au`
- Go to dev console and see what indices you have access to.

#TODO:  write a query to count the number of documents accessible
